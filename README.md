This is a Vue.js weather test application. This project was done in 2 hours. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

# How to Run
First, make sure you have added the required .env file in the root directory, which must contain the OpenWeatherMap API key.
An example .env file is provided in the repository.
The required .env file must contain the following variables:
- `VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`

Then just simply do the following:
1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
2. Run the application: `yarn serve`

The application should now be running on http://localhost:5173.
